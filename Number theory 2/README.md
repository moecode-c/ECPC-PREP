# Number Theory 2 - Quick Revision

## Problem A: GCD Queries
**What:** Compute gcd(a, b) for each test case.  
**How:** Iterative Euclidean algorithm.  
**Complexity:** O(log(min(a, b))) per test case

## Notes
- This folder currently has Problem A only.
- Add new sections (B, C, ...) as more problems are solved.
