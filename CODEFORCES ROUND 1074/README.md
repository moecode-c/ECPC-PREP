# Codeforces Round 1074 - Notes

## Problem A
**What:** Print numbers from 1 to n for each test case.  
**Complexity:** O(n) per test case

## Problem B
**What:** Read array, compute max element, print max * n.  
**Complexity:** O(n) per test case

## Problem C
**Status:** Template file only (not solved yet).

## Problem D
**What:** Process capped updates with reset behavior when value exceeds h.  
**Approach:** Versioning/lazy reset arrays (`version`, `currentver`) to avoid O(n) full reset each time.  
**Complexity:** O(n + m) per test case
